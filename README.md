Hi, I've an bachelor in Computer science. I like to work in `web development` & `machine learning`. 
In the past I've worked in these technologies.

 - Web development
   - React.js
   - Node.js
 - Machine learning
   - Numpy
   - Pandas
   - Scikit learn
   - Keras
   - Tenserflow

 - Databases
   - MongoDB
   - Firebase
   - MySQL
   - SQL Server

Other than development I really love to talk about `astronomy`, `quantum mechanics`, `quantum computing` & other sciency stuff.
